Optical Mark Recogntion: Answer Sheet Checker using C++ in wxDev

This software was un undergraduate project of mine where I used wxDev to make a GUI for my OMR code.
It uses C++ and openCV to import an image as an answer sheet and scans the page to generate an answer key.
Then, an answer sheet can be imported and scanned for the answers which is checked against the answer key and generate the score.
A csv file of the scores is generated/updated everytime the save key is clicked..
